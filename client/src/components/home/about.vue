              My philosophy is that we are all here on earth for a very limited amount of time,
              so we must try our best to make a positive contribution to the society,
              no matter how small that is, and leave this world a better place
              than how we found it.

              I love articulating real world phenomena and visualizing data and abstract concepts through code.
              So a lot of the personal projects include some sort of data visualization.
              I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge on things such as creating scalable software systems,
              building robust infrastructures, or using data for machine learning and deep learning
              to solve real-world problems.
            </p>

              In my free time, I find solace in playing guitar, travelling, hiking,
              or reading about space and astronomy.
